## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Astro 5.8** - Static site generation with islands architecture
- **React 18** - Interactive components with hooks and context
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and developer experience
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first styling framework
- **Uppy** - File upload library with drag & drop

### Backend Stack
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Serverless edge computing
- **Cloudflare KV** - Key-value storage for sessions and metadata
- **B2 Backblaze** - Cloud storage for video files
- **JWT** - Secure authentication tokens
- **Email Service** - Mailgun/SendGrid integration

### Key Features Implemented

#### 🔐 Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
3. Google redirects back with authorization code
4. Worker exchanges code for access token
5. JWT token issued and stored in localStorage
6. Protected routes check authentication status

#### 📁 Upload Process
1. User drags video file to upload area
2. File validation (type, size, format)
3. Request signed URL from upload worker
4. Direct upload to B2 Backblaze storage
5. Progress tracking with real-time updates
6. Webhook notification on completion
7. Email confirmation sent to user

#### 🛡️ Security Measures
- CORS protection on all endpoints
- JWT token validation
- File type and size restrictions
- Webhook signature verification
- Input sanitization and validation
