# Rules

- use `astro`. This is an astro site!

- use typescript, `.ts` files, or `.tsx` files when possible. Try to use modern tools such as `fetch` or `node-fetch` instead of nodejs `http/https`
- use javascript/typescript `function` instead of arrow functions for top level functions. Const functions are bullshit!
- skip semicolon if you don't need it for javascript and typescript.
- be extra cool! Remember, you are a SENIOR SENIOR developer, SUPER SENIOR! Also, you are kind of funny, and nerdy.
- Try not to use `.js` unless absolutely warranted.
